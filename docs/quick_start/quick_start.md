# Getting Started with Apache Kyuubi


## Getting Kyuubi

Currently, Apache Kyuubi maintains all its releases on our official [website](https://kyuubi.apache.org/releases.html).
You can get the most recent stable release of Apache Kyuubi here:

<p><a class="btn btn-neutral" href="https://kyuubi.apache.org/releases.html" data-color-scheme="no-preference: light; light: dark; dark: light;" data-icon="octicon-download" data-size="large" aria-label="Download Kyuubi"><span class="fa fa-arrow-circle-down" aria-hidden="true"></span>Download</a></p>

## Requirements

These are essential components required for Kyuubi to startup.
For quick start deployment, the only thing you need is `JAVA_HOME` and `SPARK_HOME` being correctly set.
The Kyuubi release package you downloaded or built contains the rest prerequisites inside already.

Components| Role | Optional | Version | Remarks
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Java | Java<br>Runtime<br>Environment | Required | Java 8/11 | Kyuubi is pre-built with Java 8
Spark | Distributed<br>SQL<br>Engine | Required | 3.0.0 and above | By default Kyuubi binary release is delivered without<br> a Spark tarball.
HDFS | Distributed<br>File<br>System |  Optional | referenced<br>by<br>Spark | Hadoop Distributed File System is a <br>part of Hadoop framework, used to<br> store and process the datasets.<br> You can interact with any<br> Spark-compatible versions of HDFS.
Hive | Metastore | Optional | referenced<br>by<br>Spark | Hive Metastore for Spark SQL to connect
Zookeeper | Service<br>Discovery | Optional | Any<br>zookeeper<br>ensemble<br>compatible<br>with<br>curator(2.12.0) | By default, Kyuubi provides a<br> embedded Zookeeper server inside for<br> non-production use.

Additionally, if you want to work with other Spark compatible systems or plugins, you only need to take care of them as using them with regular Spark applications.
For example, you can run Spark SQL engines created by the Kyuubi on any cluster manager, including YARN, Kubernetes, Mesos, e.t.c...
Or, you can manipulate data from different data sources with the Spark Datasource API, e.g. Delta Lake, Apache Hudi, Apache Iceberg, Apache Kudu and e.t.c...

## Installation

To install Kyuubi, you need to unpack the tarball. For example,

```bash
tar zxf apache-kyuubi-1.3.1-incubating-bin.tgz
```

This will result in the creation of a subdirectory named `apache-kyuubi-1.3.1-incubating-bin` shown below,

```bash

## Running Kyuubi

As mentioned above, for a quick start deployment, then only you need to be sure is that your java runtime environment and `SPARK_HOME` are correct.

### Setup JAVA

You can either set it system-widely, e.g. in the `.bashrc` file.

```bash
java -version
java version "1.8.0_251"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_251-b08)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.251-b08, mixed mode)
```

Or, `export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java` in the local os session.

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.5.jdk/Contents/Home
java -version
java version "11.0.5" 2019-10-15 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.5+10-LTS)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.5+10-LTS, mixed mode)
```

The recommended place to set `JAVA_HOME` is `$KYUUBI_HOME/conf/kyuubi-env.sh`, as the ways above are too flaky.
The `JAVA_HOME` in `$KYUUBI_HOME/conf/kyuubi-env.sh` will take others' precedence.

### Setup Spark

Similar to `JAVA_HOME`, you can also set `SPARK_HOME` in different ways. However, we recommend setting it in `$KYUUBI_HOME/conf/kyuubi-env.sh` too.

For example,

```bash
SPARK_HOME=~/Downloads/spark-3.2.0-bin-hadoop3.2
```

### Starting Kyuubi

```bash
bin/kyuubi start
```

It will print all essential environment variables on the screen during the server starts, and you may check whether they are expected.

```log

Welcome to

                /\___/
                \/__/
```

If all goes well, this will result in the creation of the Kyuubi server instance with a `PID` stored in `$KYUUBI_HOME/pid/kyuubi-<username>-org.apache.kyuubi.server.KyuubiServer.pid`

Then, you can get the JDBC connection URL at the end of the log file, e.g.

```
ThriftFrontendService: Starting and exposing JDBC connection at: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10009/
```

If something goes wrong, you shall be able to find some clues in the log file too.

Alternatively, it can run in the foreground, with the logs and other output written to stdout/stderr.
Both streams should be captured if using a supervision system like `supervisord`.

```bash
bin/kyuubi run
```

## Using Hive Beeline

Kyuubi server is compatible with Apache Hive beeline, so you can use `$SPARK_HOME/bin/beeline` for testing.

### Opening a Connection

The command below will tell the Kyuubi server to create a session with itself.

```logtalk
bin/beeline -u 'jdbc:hive2://localhost:10009/'
Connecting to jdbc:hive2://localhost:10009/
Connected to: Spark SQL (version 1.0.2)
Driver: Hive JDBC (version 2.3.7)
Transaction isolation: TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ
Beeline version 2.3.7 by Apache Hive
0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10009/>
```

In this case, the session will create for the user named 'anonymous'.

Kyuubi will create a Spark SQL engine application using `kyuubi-spark-sql-engine_2.12-<version>.jar`.
It will cost awhile for the application to be ready before fully establishing the session.
Otherwise, an existing application will be reused, and the time cost here is negligible.

Similarly, you can create a session for another user(or principal, subject, and maybe something else you defined), e.g. named `kentyao`,

```bash
bin/beeline -u 'jdbc:hive2://localhost:10009/' -n kentyao
```

The formerly created Spark application for user 'anonymous' will not be reused in this case, while a brand new application will be submitted for user 'kentyao' instead.

Then, you can see 3 processes running in your local environment, including one `KyuubiServer` instance and 2 `SparkSubmit` instances as the SQL engines.

```
75730 Jps
70843 KyuubiServer
72566 SparkSubmit
75356 SparkSubmit
```

### Execute Statements

If the beeline session is successfully connected, then you can run any query supported by Spark SQL now. For example,

```logtalk
0: jdbc:hive2://10.242.189.214:2181/> select timestamp '2018-11-17';
2021-10-28 13:56:27.509 INFO operation.ExecuteStatement: Processing kent's query[1f619182-20ad-4733-995b-a5e43b80d998]: INITIALIZED_STATE -> PENDING_STATE, statement: select timestamp '2018-11-17'

```

As shown in the above case, you can retrieve all the operation logs, the result schema, and the result to your client-side in the beeline console.

Additionally, some useful information about the background Spark SQL application associated with this connection is also printed in the operation log.
For example, you can get the Spark web UI from the log for debugging or tuning.

### Closing a Connection

Close the session between beeline and Kyuubi server by executing `!quit`, for example,

```bash
0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10009/> !quit
Closing: 0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10009/
```

## Stopping Kyuubi

Stop Kyuubi by running the following in the `$KYUUBI_HOME` directory:

```bash
bin/kyuubi stop
```

And then, you will see the KyuubiServer waving goodbye to you.

```logtalk
Stopping org.apache.kyuubi.server.KyuubiServer
  __  __                           __
 /\ \/\ \                         /\ \      __
 \ \ \/'/'  __  __  __  __  __  __\ \ \____/\_\
  \ \ , <  /\ \/\ \/\ \/\ \/\ \/\ \\ \ '__`\/\ \
   \ \ \\`\\ \ \_\ \ \ \_\ \ \ \_\ \\ \ \L\ \ \ \
    \ \_\ \_\/`____ \ \____/\ \____/ \ \_,__/\ \_\
     \/_/\/_/`/___/> \/___/  \/___/   \/___/  \/_/
                /\___/
                \/__/
Bye!
```

The `KyuubiServer` instance will be stopped immediately while the SQL engine's application will still be alive for a while.

If you start Kyuubi again before the SQL engine application terminates itself, it will reconnect to the newly created `KyuubiServer` instance.
